## some notes on netlogo

http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

If you save a model from Netlogo as Netlogo Web

It will create an large html file that contains your model as well

as a entire copy of the web based Netlogo Web that can run in your off-line browser!!!

looking at the html file it is about 83,000 lines of code!!! 

but could be useful for showing a model at school


## module 2

In module 2 I made a plot of the logistic map in P5.js of X over T with a slider for R

I also made a plot of the logistic bifurcation diagram in p5js

I have also made a logistic bifurcation diagram explorer

This chapter was on dynamics, linear vs non linear systems, and deterministic chaos.

The logistic model and logistic map were used as examples.

I also put the netlogo model from the advanced homework.

## Module 3 Fractals

Often called objects that are self-similar at different levels

or mostly self-similar.

Using a mathematical definition of dimension

fractals are objects without whole number dimensions.

D = log(N)/ log(M)

N is the number of copies of previous level.

M is the reduction factor of side from previous level.

D is also called the Hausdorff dimension.

Koch curve has a D = log(4)/log(3)  

1.2618595071429148

See netLogo model for more information.

The Box Counting Method was also introduced 

for natural fractals that are not purely mathematical.  

They had created a cool netLogo model that would 

get the box counting method of an image.


The videos had a really good review of log function

The Advanced homework is work on L-systems which I have 

created in python and javaScript.

I have included some python L-systems in this repository

and will link to others below.
