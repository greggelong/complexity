## some notes on netlogo

http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

If you save a model from Netlogo as Netlogo Web

It will create an large html file that contains your model as well

as a entire copy of the web based Netlogo Web that can run in your offline browser!!!

looking at the html file it is about 83,000 lines of code!!! 

but could be useful for showing a model at school
