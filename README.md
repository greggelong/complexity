A place to hold netlogo code, links and notes, for introduction to complexity

## some notes on netlogo

http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

If you save a model from Netlogo as Netlogo Web

It will create an large html file that contains your model as well

as a entire copy of the web based Netlogo Web that can run in your offline browser!!!

looking at the html file it is about 83,000 lines of code!!! 

but could be useful for showing a model at school


## module 2

In module 2 I made a plot of the logistic map in P5.js of X over T with a silder for R

I also made a plot of the logistic bifurcation diagram in p5js

This chapter was on dynamics, linear vs non linerar systems, and deterministic chaos.

The logistic model and logistic map were used as examples.

I also put the netlogo model from the advanced homework.
